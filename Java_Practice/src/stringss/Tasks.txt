1. Text Processing Efficiency: Write a Java program that takes a large text file as input and compares the performance of StringBuilder and StringBuffer for concatenating strings. Measure and compare the execution time for each approach to determine which one is more efficient for handling large amounts of text.

Test Cases for Q.1: Text Processing Efficiency
- Test Case 1: Concatenate two long strings using StringBuilder and StringBuffer and measure the execution time for each.
- Test Case 2: Concatenate 100 small strings into one large string using StringBuilder and StringBuffer and compare the memory usage.
- Test Case 3: Concatenate two long strings in a loop (e.g., 100,000 times) using StringBuilder and StringBuffer and measure the overall execution time.

2. Parallel String Concatenation: Create a multi-threaded Java application that simulates multiple threads concurrently appending strings to a common result using both StringBuilder and StringBuffer. Evaluate the thread safety and performance characteristics of each class in a concurrent environment.

Test Cases for Q.2: Parallel String Concatenation
- Test Case 1: Create 5 threads that simultaneously append strings to a common StringBuilder and StringBuffer instance. Verify that the final result is the concatenation of all appended strings.
- Test Case 2: Stress test the application by creating 100 threads appending long strings concurrently and ensure thread safety.

3. String Reversal: Implement a Java program that reverses a given input string using both StringBuilder and StringBuffer. Compare the execution time and memory usage of each approach for reversing strings of different lengths.

Test Cases for Q.3: String Reversal
- Test Case 1: Reverse a short string using StringBuilder and StringBuffer and verify that the result is the reversed string.
- Test Case 2: Reverse a very long string (e.g., one million characters) using StringBuilder and StringBuffer and measure the execution time.

4. Text Manipulation: Build a text manipulation tool in Java that allows users to perform various operations on a text input, such as replacing specific substrings, inserting text at certain positions, and deleting text. Use both StringBuilder and StringBuffer to implement these operations and compare their performance for different text manipulation tasks.

Test Cases for Q.4: Text Manipulation
- Test Case 1: Replace a specific substring with another string using both StringBuilder and StringBuffer and verify the correctness of the replaced text.
- Test Case 2: Insert text at various positions in a string using StringBuilder and StringBuffer and check if the resulting string is as expected.
- Test Case 3: Delete specific substrings from a string using StringBuilder and StringBuffer and ensure that the text is correctly modified.

5. Dynamic Text Generation: Develop a Java application that generates dynamic text content by concatenating various parts of a template, where each part is represented as a string. Compare the usability and efficiency of StringBuilder and StringBuffer when constructing such dynamic text content with multiple concatenations and variable substitutions.

Test Cases for Q.5: Dynamic Text Generation
- Test Case 1: Create a dynamic text using StringBuilder and StringBuffer by concatenating various parts of a template. Verify that the generated text matches the expected output.
- Test Case 2: Measure the execution time for generating dynamic text with a varying number of concatenations and substitutions using both StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
- Test Case 3: Test the application with different templates and ensure it handles various input scenarios effectively.
